- **Digital Twin Systems for Reconfigurable Soft Robots (2023-present)**

<div style="text-align: justify">
  In this study, we propose an innovative approach to constructing a digital twin (DT) system for reconfigurable soft robots in an augmented reality (AR) environment. Our approach utilizes armature-based methods to modify and reconstruct the digital twin of reconfigurable soft robots in the AR environment, allowing for continuous representation of their deformations. We identify three fundamental types of deformation patterns - stretching, bending, and twisting - and propose corresponding visualization patterns to represent these transformations accurately. Additionally, we employ a sensor fusion method to capture the soft robot's deformation as a parameterized curve, enabling more precise visualization in the AR environment. The proposed framework is implemented in the AR environment, providing immersive inspection and reconfigurable simulation for real-world soft robots, enhancing their adaptability and functionality.

- **Three-levels Digital Twin Systems for Human-Robot Interaction (2022-present)**

 <div style="text-align: justify">
  This research focuses on the development of a novel Augmented Reality (AR)-based digital twin system for human-robot interaction in manufacturing settings, with the aim of improving efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. A three-level approach to digital twin technology is introduced, comprising virtual twin, hybrid twin, and cognitive twin levels, each offering unique functionalities. An intuitive AR-based interface is created, enabling users to interact with the digital twin through natural gestures, thereby streamlining programming and control processes. A comprehensive human-centric user study is conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed system in minimizing setup time, reducing errors, and enhancing overall productivity.

- **Data-Driven Shape Optimization Design for Auxetics Using Isogeometric Analysis (2019-2021)**

   <div style="text-align: justify">
  This project implements a back-propagation neural network (BPNN)-based design framework for petal-shaped auxetics using isogeometric analysis, and proposes a deep neural networks (DNN) framework for tetra-chiral auxetics shape optimization design. The highly nonlinear relation between the input geometry variables and the effective material properties is fitted by a data-driven method (i.e., BPNN, DNN), facilitated by the NURBS-based parametric modeling scheme with a small number of design variables. This enables an easy analytical sensitivity analysis, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency. Optimal auxetic structures are produced using 3D printing and experimentally tested for their properties. The implementation is based on the collaboration between Matlab and TensorFlow.

- **Multiple Accelerated Methods for Mesh-based and Isogeometric Topology Optimization (2018-2019)**

  <div style="text-align: justify">
  This research proposes multilevel mesh, effective iterative methods, and local-update strategies to accelerate computing efficiency in topology optimization. For mesh-based topology optimization, the method projects density from coarse to fine meshes to accelerate convergence, adopts an initial-value-based preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method to solve the equations of Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and decreases the number of updated meshes according to their density. This results in a 35%-80% reduction in computational time compared to the classical TOP88 code. For isogeometric topology optimization, where control points are the design variables, the method applies *h*-refinement to subdivide the mesh, adopts a Multigrid conjugate gradient method (MGCG) to solve the equilibrium equation, and reduces control points according to their density. This successfully reduces 37%-93% of computational time compared to unaccelerated cases. The multiple accelerated methods perform better in large-scale cases and have general applicability for topology optimizations based on either meshes or control points.

- **Graded-density Lattice Structure Optimization Design Based on Topology Optimization (2017-2018)**

  <div style="text-align: justify">
  This research proposes a multiscale topology optimization method based on the homogenization method, which generates graded-density lattice structures according to actual loads to achieve optimal performance. The method combines MATLAB with ANSYS, where optimization is performed in MATLAB and FEA computing and modeling are conducted in ANSYS. The lattice structure is rebuilt using Rhinoceros. Compared with the beam-model-based lattice optimization method from commercial software HyperWorks, the proposed method achieves better performance in mass reduction and stress distribution. The feasibility of manufacturing the lattice structure is demonstrated through 3D printing.
